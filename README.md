This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed as part of the GIAIC program. Each project demonstrates different aspects of programming. showcasing the practical application of various concepts.

## Projects

### Project 01: **Mad Libs Game**
- **Description**: A fun and interactive game where users fill in the blanks to create a unique story. The program asks for various inputs such as a name, place, adjective, noun, verb, and animal, and then creates a funny story using those inputs.

### Project 02: **Guess the Number Game**
- **Description**: An interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed, and tracks the number of attempts.

### Project 3: **Computer Guess the Number Game**
- **Description**: In this version of the game, the player thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and the computer tries to guess it. The player provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The computer adjusts its guesses based on the feedback, aiming to guess the number in the fewest attempts.

### Project 4: **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
- **Description**: A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The player chooses one of the three options, and the computer randomly selects one. The game determines the winner based on the classic rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock). The player can choose to play multiple rounds.

### Project 5: **Hangman Game**
- **Description**: A traditional Hangman game where the player must guess a word, one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and displays the word with blanks as the player progresses. The game ends either when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

### Project 6: **Countdown Timer**
- **Description**: A countdown timer that allows the user to input a time in seconds. The program counts down from the specified time and displays the time remaining in HH:MM:SS format. When the time reaches zero, the program outputs a "Time's up!" message.

### Project 7: **Password Generator**
- **Description**: A password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length and the number of passwords. The passwords include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance security.
- **Link**: [Project 07](https://github.com/sheikh92areeb/GIAIC-Projects/tree/main/project-07)

### Project 8: **BMI Calculator (Streamlit App)**
- **Description**: A web-based BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Streamlit. Users can input their weight (in kg) and height (in cm), and the app calculates their BMI and provides an interpretation of the result, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.
- **Link**: [Project 08](https://github.com/sheikh92areeb/GIAIC-Projects/tree/main/project-08)
   
### Project 9: **Streamlit Website**
- **Description**: A simple web application built with Streamlit that features multiple pages: Home, About, Data Visualization, and Contact. It includes interactive elements such as data visualization using pandas and matplotlib, and a contact form.
